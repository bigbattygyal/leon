		Far too often, I share my life story with whoever asks. Maybe that's a problem, I don't know. A tarot reader told me in August 2024 to stop telling everyone my business because my story can get in the wrong hands and people can put bad energy onto it. I think it was more of a future thing, where it's a problem with me sharing my future plans, because she told me to tell people everything after it's done. But either way, I think it's safe to share my past, so I'm going to share with you what happened for me to be here now.

		I segment my life by where I live. I don't really know why, it's just sort of always been that way. The places I've lived coincidentally match up with big stages of my life so it's easy to chunk my life into different chapters based on where I lived. So, here we go.
		
		<h4><i>The House in a Park</i></h4>
		<img src="https://i.imgur.com/WhpTtyN.jpeg" alt="me in the grass" width="200" height="200">
		<br>
		I was born in Vancouver, BC. I'm told it was at British Columbia Women's Hospital, but honestly, my parents could be lying to me and it's not like I remember that day anyway. I don't know how it happened, but my dad and mom lived as caretakers for this park in Richmond, the city where I grew up. It was wild - we basically lived in a forest, yet, we were less than a block away from a strip mall. Some of my earliest memories were with my mom as I was insisting to her that I'm big enough to walk instead of being in the stroller, as we walked to the Rogers Video store to get movies. It was a great place to grow up - a big enough house for my dad, mom, sister, and me. Big fireplace, and parents that were rough enough around the edges to give me a pretty cool childhood.
		<br><br>
		Other earliest memories include my first nightmare, where I woke up crying. In the dream, I snuck out the back sliding door and went to jump on our trampoline outside, at night. I got tired and I rested on my back on the trampoline, then a low flying plane slowly stopped and hovered over me. The door opened on the plane, sliding line a minivan door, and a skeleton leaned out, beckoning me. I freaked tf out and woke up crying. The other memory I have is my sister, who is two years older, telling me that I would be safe turning 4. I was scared to turn 4, I don't know why. I think that was when I started to conceptualize responsibility, but also death (at not-even-four???). She told me that I'd get to do so many cool things, and other things I don't remember. Honestly, I was looking outside at the trees but her telling me I would be ok was enough - I believed her.
		<br><br>
		I honestly don't remember all too much during the time we lived here. It was the beginning of my parents' divorce, and also I was so young. All I remember is that it was a real gift to be living in a place that's was so open for me to run around, goof off, and explore. Maybe that led me to become who I am now. Probably.
		
		<br><br>
		<h4><i>The Townhouse</i></h4>
		We moved to a new place still in Richmond that was a typical townhouse. Lots of kids, right beside the elementary school my sister and I ended up going to. I don't remember all too much, but this is when my parents divorce got really messy. My mom stayed in the house when my dad left, but they shared custody so we still got to see both parents. I liked that townhouse because my sister and I got to share a room and when shit got bad we still were there for each other. She always got the top bunk of our bunk bed wherever we went, but it was good because the lower bunk had more room and I kick in my sleep.
		<br><br>
		It was a nice community, too. Lots of trees to climb, super close walk to school, and it also had a pool where I learned how to swim. There was also this convenience store, 99 Mart, that sold Chubby Soda. I always used to get the orange, and I can never find the orange flavour let alone the Chubby Soda itself. It was a fun place to live, being so young and having such an open environment for me to be a kid with other kids. Except my parents got mad because our neighbour's kid stole our TV remote. Not sure what happened after that, but my parents were pissed. We stayed at this place until I was in about grade 2.
