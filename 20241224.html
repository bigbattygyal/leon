		For as long as I can remember I've written stuff down. Like, my notes app is a wild mess, my Instagram close friends is pretty well my diary, but also I just generally love to share. Here, I'll have entries that I want to share. Maybe they're in a moment, or maybe they're from the past, or maybe they're looking to the future. I don't know how this is going to shape out, but I'll include the index below.

		It's Christmas Eve and I just got back from my grandma's house. It feels like my family gets smaller ever year, but this year it was just my grandma, my dad, my sister, and me at our Christmas Eve dinner. We had ham, scalloped potatoes, numerous vegetables, and this nice brand of ice cream (avalon) and some strawberry sauce that my grandma keeps on hand for when strawberries are out of season.
		<br><br>
		Every year, Christmas feels more different. It used to be consistent, but with me becoming more of an adult it's getting to be further from what I remember it as. Now that I live further away from my family, I had to Uber in to my grandma's and getting the gifts and such ready was different because it was the first time I left for Christmas dinner by myself. The Uber was a Tesla Model Y, so I got to look out the side window, and through the roof. As I crossed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_Gate_Bridge">Lions Gate Bridge</a>, it was strange looking through the roof at the lights go up towards the mast in the middle. All the years I've spent in Vancouver I've never looked up when I crossed the bridge... only at the age of 23 did I get this view. It was amazing; the bridge is huge and honestly it's so beautiful. I felt old, not in a bad way, but just that I've done so much and seen so much. I wouldn't say it was a proud feeling, just a sort of, "so this is the life I live now." It was an interesting feeling.

		I wanted to share this song with you; Café con Leche by Simon Grossmann. I came across this artist in late March of 2023 when I was in a real pit, and I like the way he structures his songs. He has a rasp in his voice that I like, yet it's soft, loving, and good feeling. It's good to sway to. This song does a good job at capturing how I felt when I got back to my apartment after my dad dropped me off. I felt like I could sway, mumble the words, and feel at home. Café con Leche does a good job at giving me a homey feeling and after the adult feeling of irreversible change that can be scary at first glance, I leaned into it once I locked my door. I'm really proud of where I've landed. I have a comfy home that I've made my own, with things slowly making their way onto my walls reminding me of the life I've lived so far and I can sway with all the beauty I've accumulated; "Ahí viene el mar con su vaivén y tu sonrisa."	
		<br><br>
		So as I'm writing this, I'm just thankful. I'm thankful for the life I've been able to create, and the people who are on the journey with me. Thanks for being here, and thanks for sharing this moment with me. I've been able to pay witness to a whole lot of beauty this year, and I'm really happy to have had the chance to do it alongside some of the coolest people in the world! I hope you're able to share this moment and be proud of what we've created in our own ways. May the lives we've created continue to give us many reasons to smile, many new people to connect with, and more moments than we can imagine where we sit in awe of the beauty in this world. Woohoo!
